\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, the proposed decentralized cloud platform signifies a substantial advancement in the field of cloud computing. By harnessing the capabilities of distributed systems and blockchain technology, this platform is poised to democratize access to computational resources, reduce costs, stimulate competition, enhance environmental sustainability, and improve resilience and security.

Certainly, the implementation of such a transformative platform will present its own set of challenges. However, the potential benefits and the profound impact of this platform make it a venture of great significance. We are not merely suggesting a minor modification to the cloud computing industry - we are advocating for a comprehensive transformation with far-reaching implications for society and the economy.

Contrary to the majority of preceding web3 projects, our platform does not necessitate a complete overhaul of existing applications. These applications can continue to operate as usual, but on a decentralized cloud. A cloud that does not tolerate misconduct from cloud service providers, and does not succumb to vendor lock-in. Cloud that we all deserve. Cloud as it should have been.
