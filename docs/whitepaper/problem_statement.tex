\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}

The current cloud computing paradigm is dominated by a few large providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. These providers offer a wide range of services, from basic compute and storage to advanced machine learning and analytics tools. However, this centralized model has several drawbacks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vendor lock-in:} Once a user chooses a cloud provider, it can be difficult to switch to another provider due to differences in service offerings, APIs, and pricing models.
    \item \textbf{Limited control and transparency:} Users have little control over where and how their data is stored and processed. They also have limited visibility into the underlying infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Data privacy and security:} Centralized cloud providers are attractive targets for hackers. Despite the security measures put in place by these providers, data breaches can and do occur. A breach at the level of a cloud provider can provide the attacker with access to all services and data hosted by the cloud provider.
    \item \textbf{Cost:} The pricing models of cloud providers can be complex and unpredictable. Users may end up paying for resources they don't use.
\end{itemize}
