This paper introduces an innovative decentralized cloud platform that bridges the gap between traditional centralized cloud services and fully decentralized systems. Our platform enables developers to access virtual or physical servers tailored to their specific needs, offered by identifiable node providers with established reputations and backed by robust legal contracts and guarantees.

Unlike typical decentralized cloud platforms, our approach requires node providers to build and maintain long-term reputations, allowing users to select providers based on their track record of reliability and performance. This novel reputation-based system addresses key challenges inherent in both centralized and existing decentralized cloud computing models, including vendor lock-in, opaque pricing, and barriers to entry for new providers.

Our platform uniquely supports sensitive data processing through Confidential Computing VMs and facilitates the rental of GPU nodes for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications at competitive market rates. This flexibility caters to a wide range of developer preferences, from those seeking the lowest-cost options to those prioritizing high-end hardware and provider reputation.

By running the control plane on a blockchain for financial transactions and reputation tracking, while keeping the performance-sensitive data plane on the regular Internet, our platform overcomes a significant limitation of conventional web3 platforms. This architecture allows developers to leverage the benefits of decentralized systems without the need to re-engineer existing applications, providing a seamless transition path for legacy software while still offering the guarantees associated with web3 technologies.

Decent Cloud offers substantial benefits for both node providers and developers. Developers can (a) find cloud providers suitable for their specific needs, (b) secure legal guarantees and SLA agreements typically expected by businesses, and (c) utilize services from multiple providers with minimal added complexity. For node providers, it provides access to the trillion-dollar crypto market and a vast global user base. Crucially, Decent Cloud mitigates the "race to the bottom" pricing common in other decentralized cloud computing platforms by implementing transparent, decentralized pricing and a reputation system that encourages and rewards honest behavior.

In conclusion, our platform represents a significant advancement in cloud computing, offering a trust-based, flexible, and efficient solution that combines the best aspects of centralized and decentralized systems to meet the diverse needs of modern developers and enterprises.
