This paper introduces a novel decentralized cloud platform that bridges the gap between traditional centralized cloud services and fully decentralized systems. Our platform enables developers to access tailored virtual or physical servers, offered by identifiable and legally responsible node providers with established reputations.

Unlike typical decentralized platforms, our approach requires node providers to provide their businesses contact details and commitments, and to build their reputations over long periods of time, which in turn allows users to make an informed decision when selecting node providers. This reputation-based system addresses key challenges in both centralized and existing decentralized cloud models, including vendor lock-in, opaque pricing, and barriers to entry.

In addition to the regular Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) servers, Decent Cloud also supports sensitive data processing through Confidential Computing VMs and facilitates GPU node rental for ML and AI applications at competitive rates. By running the control plane on a blockchain while keeping the performance-sensitive data plane on the regular Internet, we overcome limitations of conventional web3 platforms, allowing seamless integration of legacy applications.

Decent Cloud offers substantial benefits for both node providers and developers. {\bf Developers} can (a) find cloud providers suitable for their specific needs, (b) obtain legal guarantees and SLA agreements that most  businesses require, and (c) utilize services from multiple providers (multi-cloud deployments) with minimal added complexity. For {\bf Node Providers}, it provides access to the trillion-dollar crypto market and this way reach a vast global user base. Crucially for node providers, Decent Cloud mitigates the "race to the bottom" pricing that plagues other decentralized cloud computing platforms, by implementing transparent, decentralized pricing {\em and} a reputation system that encourages and rewards honest behavior.
